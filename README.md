# React-Native-ToDo

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npx react-native start
```
Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:


For Android
```bash

npx react-native run-android
```
For iOS

```bash

npx react-native run-ios
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode, respectively.

Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes.

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes.

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸ¥³
